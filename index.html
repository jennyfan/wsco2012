        <p>On behalf of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton Supply Chain Organization, we are delighted to welcome you to the inaugural Wharton Global Supply Chain Conference. We are proud to host this first of its kind conference at Wharton that will disseminate crucial operational know-how.</p>

	<p>Behind every successful corporation is an outstanding supply chain. This conference will show us how ten of the world's finest enterprises operate.</p>

<p>The kick-off theme "Optimize to Thrive: Incorporating Innovation to Transform your Enterprise", will witness some of our favorite firms sharing the best practices and innovative strategies that make their supply chains truly outstanding. Our speakers are Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents who have transformed some of the world's largest supply chains and we salute them for such remarkable managerial ability. They will offer their personal insights on how to optimize with the supply chain to succeed in unpredictable times.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="span6">
        <p>With the panels representing as many as 7 industries of Hi-Tech, E-commerce, Pharmaceuticals, Aerospace & Defense, Chemicals, Consumer Products, and Retail, this conference brings forth the world of cutting edge operations right here at the Wharton School.</p>
    
    <p>We invite you to take home this exclusive knowledge, build new relationships, and begin to lead the next chapter of operational innovation.</p>

        <div class="row row-fluid">
            <div class="span4">
            <h2>Panel 1</h2>
        <h3>High Technology</h3>
        <p>Chips, components, panels. How are these assembled in the best possible way to build some of the decade's most outstanding PCs & smart-phones? (e.g. what went into the making of the Samsung Galaxy S3). On the other hand, Google delivers search results as fast as possible at the lowest potential cost owing to its specialized infrastructure of fiber-networks, switches, servers & storage devices. We will explore the strategies adopted by our panelists to manage and optimize on these gigantic supply chains (e.g.  acquisitions, in-house manufacturing)  and get a feel of the architecture of the hi-tech future.</p>

        <h3>Innovate to Thrive</h3>
        <p>Three different industries  -  one common strategy. This panel will show when, where and how innovation can be applied in the supply chain. It will also address one of today's most pressing issues  -  transferability of supply chain innovation concepts across industries. We will also explore their individual supply chain models and our panelists will share the challenges they foresee in their respective sectors. With Chemicals, Consumer Goods, and Aerospace & Defense being the major growth sectors, this panel offers crucial insights towards tracing the present and future state of the global economy.</p>

The focus point is how Amazon & Zappos.com position their main asset, the supply chain, to maintain competitive advantage and keep their customers incredibly happy. We will explore the major components from start to finish - their excellent vendor relations, cutting edge inventory & warehousing (including Zappos.com's robots), efficient transportation & distribution, and extraordinary customer service. Finally, how can these best practices be imparted in the larger retail industry and smaller e-commerce start-ups?</p>
